# RataLab - 2016
The RataLab project exposes the development of a software, carried out in Matlab, which receives as input the video of an experiment with Wistar rats in the Barnes circular maze carried out in the animal behavior laboratory of the National University of Colombia, which is analyzed using an algorithm that uses a Gaussian mixture model to identify the movement of the mouse in the labyrinth and with the help of recognition and tracking algorithms (unsupervised machine learning), to then deliver accurate data and information such as the movement of the mouse to the user. mouse, number of holes explored, times and frequency, among others.
